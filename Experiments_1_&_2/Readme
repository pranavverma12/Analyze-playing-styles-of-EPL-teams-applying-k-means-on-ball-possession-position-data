Code for both Experiment 1 and 2 are provided in Clustering_Experiments_1_&_2.ipynb Notebook

Experiment 1 Outline:

The first subpart of experiment 1 uses data from 3 areas of the pitch (defense, midfield, and attack) to cluster home teams 
with similar playing styles. The second sub-part of experiment 1 uses the same 3 area data to cluster away teams with a 
similar playing style. 


Experiment 2 Outline:

Deeper analytics to obtain additional insights could not be obtained from the results of Experiment 1.
Hence, there is a need to conduct another experiment using the 9 zones data which was derived by partitioning the data from 
3 areas of the pitch. This second experiment is performed using the same k-means clustering technique used in experiment 1. 
The first sub-part of this experiment uses data from 9 zones of the pitch to cluster home teams with a similar playing style. 
The second subpart performs the same clustering, using the same 9 zone data but for away teams.
