Data Extraction from raw dataset.ipynb

The experiments are based on the ball possession-position data from the matches. 
So initially, the ball posses-sion co-ordinates, its corresponding camera frame number, pitch details and  
playing team names are extracted from the original dataset to build a sub dataset named ball possession-position dataset. 
This code iterates into multiple folders from the starting directory to fetch data.  

The raw dataset size is approximately 8  Gb and the .DAT Files of each match consist of 176,907 rows of data.
One Round (10matches) of data is extracted at a single time and stored in a separate CSV file. 
To extract the data of our interest, a python script leveraging libraries such as Os, Numpy, Pandas is  written.  

When this python script is executed, it creates a new CSV file with  the  required  ball  possession-position data 
for one round of matches. To build the complete subdataset, this script has to be 
incrementally iterated 21 timesto create separate CSV files for each round of matches.
