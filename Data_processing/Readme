Data Extraction from raw dataset.ipynb

The experiments   are   based   on   the   ball   possession-position data from the matches. 
So initially, the ball posses-sion co-ordinates, its corresponding camera frame number, pitch  details  and  
playing  team  names  are  extracted  fromthe   original   dataset   to   build   a   sub   dataset   named   ballpossession-position dataset. 
This code iterates into  multiple  folders  from  the  starting  directory  to  fetchd ata.  
The  raw  dataset  size  is  approximately  8  Gb  and  the .DAT  Files  of  each  match  consist  of  176,907  rows  of  data.
Combining   these   rows   with   other   XML   and   CSVâ€™s   filesmultiples  the  numbers  of  iterations.  
The complex structure of   the   dataset   demands   high   computation   resources   toFig.  1.
9  zones  and  3  areas  of  a  pitchperform   the   extraction   in   a   single   run.  
One   Round   (10matches)  of  data  is  extracted  at  a  single  time  and  storedin  a  separate  CSV  file. 
To  extract  the  data  of  our  interest,a   python   script   leveraging   libraries   such   as   Os,   Numpy,Pandas, and concepts 
from DOM (Document Object Model)is  written.  When  this  python  script  is  executed,  it  creates a  new  CSV  file  
with  the  required  ball  possession-positiondata  for  one  round  of  matches.  To  build  the  complete  subdataset, 
this script has to be incrementally iterated 21 timesto create separate CSV files for each round of matches.
EachCSV file contains approximately 500 Mb of ball possession-position  data
